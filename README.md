Hi! Welcome to the repository for my solution to this <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor challenge</a>!

# Summary
This was a really fun project to complete with CSS! I decided to recreate the images with CSS and I added some animations as well as made the graph interactable with some JavaScript. 
The follower counts are animated, the card with the graph has an animation on desktop to show it fully. The buttons for socials in the center of the page move to the left so the one that's cut off can be seen entirely on desktop as well. The graph has different data for each day when clicked.

For this challenge, I used the following: 
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- JavaScript

# Looking Back
- I'm quite pleased with my code on this one; I know I've repeated myself a few times, but overall I'm happy with it!
- My only gripe with this is that I couldn't animate the card3 element when taking the mouse off it; from what I can tell it's because of the overflow-x property since it can't be animated, and I didn't find a workaround unfortunately.

# The End
Thanks for checking out my solution to this challenge! If you have any feedback, I would love if you reached out to me or opened an issue if there's anything that needs fixing; I'm always looking to improve!

Happy coding!
